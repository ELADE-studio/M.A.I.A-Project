### FRONTEND
Dear frontend contributors, here is some rules to respect:

* Deave is the only one who can accept pull requests.
* Prime languages are HTML5, SCSS, Javascript. If a new technology become useful for us, we'll migrate.
* Respect the style.
* Respect the framework and/or layout

If you want to add some new page, watch out our website architecture on the [draw.io](architecture.drawio) file. You'll need to install the [draw.io](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio "draw.io extension on marketplace") extension to use it correctly.
### BACKEND
Dear backend contributors, don't be mad! You have a lot of work.

* Miphonya is the only one who can accept pull requests.
* If you have questions about the AI core part, ask to Miphonya, for the AI skills, ask to Deave.
* Respect the framework and/or layout

For now, there is no architecture file for the AI, but soon as possible!
